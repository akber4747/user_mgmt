	<h1>Not seldom in this life</h1>
	<p id="fogg">The Custom House clock struck one.  Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast.</p>

	<p>Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, <span id="whales"> whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.</span></p>

		<p>All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,  just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers  of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on  which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you  executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p>
		<p>I was on the point of stepping boldly out into the room when a slight noise behind me warned me back into the shadows of a recess in the corridor.  Dragging Woola after me I crouched low in the darkness.</p>

	<p class="wotw">This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,  rather shyly, 'I&mdash;I hardly know, sir, just at present&mdash;at least I know  who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been  changed several times since then.' 'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain  yourself!' 'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not  myself, you see.' 'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar. 'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,  'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many  different sizes in a day is very confusing.' 'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p>
	<p class="wotw">It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm.  He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come. Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.  The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him with a blow in the face.  Then, realising that he was deserted, he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now, following remotely. Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.</p>
